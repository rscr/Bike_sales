Goal of this project:

1.Practice Data Cleaning Process
2.Creating Dashboard in Excel

In the excel sheet i have a raw dataset, but i created a Worksheet where i can play around with Data without doing any changes on the actual Data itself.
I have created a Pivot table to have a better overview, and a Dashboard to see the results. In the Dashboard ive created Filters, Histogram and Line charts.

The problem i want to solve:

To see how many bikes are being purchased around the world base on Location, Salary, Commute distance, Age and Education
